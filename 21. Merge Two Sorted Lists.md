# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

### Notes: 
1. Don't need to create new node.
2. As these are 2 sorted list, we only need to compare heads.

### Recursive process:
#### Merge(a, b)
1. Comparing the first node of both linked list, and chooese the smaller one become the head of merged list.
2. If a's head is smaller than b's head, then merge the subsequent nodes of a and b. If b's head is smaller thatn a's head, merge the subsequent nodes of b and a.
3. The advantage of using linked list is, to access subsequent node, we only need to move next pointer.
4. Time complexity: O(n)

### Solution(Recursive):
```C
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 *
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    struct ListNode *next;
};*/

struct ListNode* mergeTwoLists(struct ListNode* list1, struct ListNode* list2){
//if one of the list is empty, return the other one.
    if(list1 == NULL){
        return list2;
    }
    if(list2 == NULL) {
        return list1;
    }
    //The smaller one becomes the head.
    if(list1->val < list2->val) {
        list1->next = mergeTwoLists(list1->next, list2);
        return list1;
    } else {
        list2->next = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2->next);
        return list2;
    }
}
