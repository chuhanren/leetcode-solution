#### Solution (Dynamic Programming)
Using bottom up dynamic programming approach\
(From step 4 to 5, 1 way\
 from step 3 to 5, 1 way\
 from step 2 to 5, 2 ways\...)

Time Complexity( O(n))
```Python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        one, two = 1, 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            temp = one
            one = one + two
            two = temp
        
        return one
```
        
#### Faster Solution
It's a fibonacci.
```C
int climbStairs(int n){
    int dp[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(i == 0) {
            dp[i] = 1;
        } else if (i == 1) {
            dp[i] = 2;
        } else if (i >= 2) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + dp[i -1];
        }
    }
    return dp[n - 1];
}
