## Solution: Two Pointer[Python]
 Initiate two pointer:\
 L = buy day,\
 R = sell day

1. If the right value is less than left, update pointer left to right, keep track of lowest item.
2. If the right value is higher than left, then we have a profit and only need to update our right pointer, right++.
3. Track the max profit.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 1  #left = buy, right = sell
        max_profit = 0

        while r < len(prices):
            # if it's profitable?
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit) #track the maximum profit
            else:
                l = r #if find another lower than left, move left pointer to be the right
            r += 1 #move right pointer
        return max_profit
